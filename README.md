# Cybersecurity Programs

Within the Cybersecurity MS Program at SNHU, I had attained knowledge on cyberlaw, telecommunications, systems engineering, information assurance, cryptography, network defense, incident management and response, as well as digital forensics. These disciplines have assisted me in understanding security fundamentals that I have placed into practice. After my first master's program, I have matriculated in the MPS Cybersecurity Risk Management Program at Georgetown University, which continues to shape my perspective on cyber as a whole.

The following criteria demonstrate the areas in which my skills from these programs reside as of now:

## Penetration Testing
In the penetration testing category, I was tasked with conducting social engineering attacks with John The Ripper, Zenmap, Nmap, SET, Armitage, and Metasploit. After performing the attacks in a simulated environment, I was placed in the role of incident responder to identify, prepare, analyze, contain, eradicate, and recover from the events. Snort, Windows Event Viewer, and the implementation of access control were incorporated as well. 

## Vulnerability and Risk Assessment
Both qualitative and quantitative assessments should be used to evaluate likelihoods in a variety of criteria. Moreover, tools such as Nmap that executes different scans or Greenbone OpenVAS can be used for detecting vulnerabilities. What I have currently learned is that cost-benefit analyses which fit in this category are related to consequentialist ethical frameworks as well.

## Awareness Training
I learned that both intentional and unintentional threats can negatively impact an organization. Malicious insiders, disgruntled employees, economic espionage, tailgating attacks, increased workplace stress, alcoholism, and illness may contribute to such threats. Instead of punishing employees, I learned how to provide room for employee mistakes that they can learn from. Likewise, gamification and incentivization are key components for providing effective security awareness training. 

## Network, Database, and Systems Security
The origins of network security I studied comprised of the OSI Model and the TCP/IP Protocol Suite. I then learned how packet traffic is intercepted, the most safe internet protocols to use, network configuration, and the algorithms implemented into network security. For example, the OSPF protocol uses Dijkstra's algorithm, and so do the traceroute/tracert commands with the use of graphs. 

I learned database security through mitigating privilege escalation, security-by-design for CRUD operations, security best practices, and how database security aligns with the CIA triad.

For systems security, I studied secure systems engineering using security-by-design with use case diagrams, sequence diagrams, UML, class diagrams, state transition diagrams, and context diagrams. I applied systems engineering fundamentals to accommodate vertical and horizontal applications as well.

## Organizational Security



## Forensics


## Ethics
In my preceding background, I understood ethics to be comprised of security best practices and policy creation. From this perspective, we were concerned with the 'how' for attacks but disregarded the 'why'. However, I have now learned that the 'why' and human motives are just as significant, as they are derived from utilitarianism, consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics. We can now see that malicious actors have a social construct in their own way of behaving and take pleasure in committing cybercrime.
