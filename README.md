# Cybersecurity MS Program

Within the Cybersecurity MS Program at SNHU, I had attained knowledge on cyberlaw, telecommunications, systems engineering, information assurance, cryptography, network defense, incident management and response, as well as digital forensics. These disciplines have assisted me in understanding security fundamentals that I have placed into practice. 

The following criteria demonstrate the areas in which my skills from this program reside:

## Penetration Testing
In the penetration testing category, I was tasked with conducting social engineering attacks with John The Ripper, Zenmap, Nmap, SET, Armitage, and Metasploit. After performing the attacks in a simulated environment, I was placed in the role of incident responder to identify, prepare, analyze, contain, eradicate, and recover from the events. Snort, Windows Event Viewer, and the implementation of access control were incorporated as well.
