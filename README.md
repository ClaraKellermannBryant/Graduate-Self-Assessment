# Cybersecurity MS Program

Within the Cybersecurity MS Program at SNHU, I had attained knowledge on cyberlaw, telecommunications, systems engineering, information assurance, cryptography, network defense, incident management and response, as well as digital forensics. These disciplines have assisted me in understanding security fundamentals that I have placed into practice. After my first master's program, I have matriculated in the MPS Cybersecurity Risk Management Program at Georgetown University, which continues to shape my perspective on cyber as a whole.

The following criteria demonstrate the areas in which my skills from these programs reside as of now:

## Penetration Testing
In the penetration testing category, I was tasked with conducting social engineering attacks with John The Ripper, Zenmap, Nmap, SET, Armitage, and Metasploit. After performing the attacks in a simulated environment, I was placed in the role of incident responder to identify, prepare, analyze, contain, eradicate, and recover from the events. Snort, Windows Event Viewer, and the implementation of access control were incorporated as well. 

## Vulnerability and Risk Assessment
Both qualitative and quantitative assessments should be used to evaluate likelihoods in a variety of criteria. Moreover, tools such as Nmap that executes different scans or Greenbone OpenVAS can be used for detecting vulnerabilities. What I have currently learned is that cost-benefit analyses which fit in this category are related to consequentialism ethical frameworks as well.
